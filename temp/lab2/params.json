{"name":"Assignment 2","tagline":"Leaflet map on a Bootstrap page","body":"### Requirements \r\nUsing the map from Assignment 1, create a webpage based on Bootstrap with mobile-friendly navigation. Put the CSS and JavaScript into separate files, and let the HTML file contain pure HTML. The navigation should include links to other sites.  \r\n### Deliverables \r\nA single zip file containing the files and folders, submitted through Moodle, or host the files online and submit the URL through Moodle.  \r\n### Deadline \r\nTuesday, February 16, at 3pm. \r\n### Tips \r\nYou’ll need to create folders and files to hold the CSS and JavaScript: \r\n\r\n    assignment2/   \r\n      index.html    \r\n      css/     \r\n        starter-template.css\r\n        style.css   \r\n      js/\r\n        script.js\r\n\r\n* Copy the JavaScript and CSS from your assignment 1 document and paste into script.js and style.css.\r\n* Edit the CSS so the map doesn’t take up the whole page (delete “html” and “body” selectors, set width and height to px). \r\n* Edit the CSS to center the map div (margin: 0 auto;).\r\n* The HTML page needs a title.  \r\n* Link the Leaflet CSS and your style.css \r\n* Put the map div into the starter-template div.\r\n* Link the Leaflet JavaScript and your script.js. \r\n* In the navbar, change “Project name” to “Assignment 2” and link it to index.html. Edit and link “Home”, “About”, and “Contact” to something else.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
